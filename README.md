## 🧠 UX Research Insights
Through user research and cognitive walkthroughs, we identified major pain points:  
1. **Housing Stress** - Students struggled with fragmented sources for accommodation.  
2. **Daily Tasks** - Grocery shopping was confusing and time-consuming.  
3. **Social Isolation** - Students desired an easier way to connect with peers and seniors.  
4. **Usability Gaps** - Filter buttons were unclear, scroll prompts were missing, and location permission recovery was confusing.  

These insights shaped the design decisions to prioritize **clarity, accessibility, and community support**.
